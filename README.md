# Git Branching Flow
This is a test and example of my Git branching flow. It is pretty much just git-flow but less complicated. 
It uses a `main` branch which is the latest stable release, a `develop` branch which is in active development, and `feature/...` branches for features.
I might also use `bugfix/...` branches. Version changes and other simple edits are made directly to the develop branch.

This is the first commit.
This is the second commit in the develop branch. And this is the third commit.
This edit was made in the feature branch.

Congratulations, we are now at version 1.0!
